Put the flag into proper format : ForestyCTF{Street Name_Postal
Code_City_Country} e.g ForestyCTF{Varnaun St_IU33 8SI_Paris_France}

Open the drive link, and a video will appear as below:

First of all, we judge from the video environment, it can be seen that the place
it is located in europe, you can see the shape of the building, as well
street symbols in the video

Then there is one highlight that is visible to us, which is a symbol
"Underground which only exists in the country "England", can be seen at
picture below:

The symbol image above is similar to the image below:

From the picture above you can see the shape of the building to the left of the symbol
very identical to the building that is in the video and happens to be on
the wikipedia page explains that the "Underground Sign" is located
at Westminster Station in London, England. So therefore
we checked on google street view as below:

And can be seen above is a street view that is on
Westminster Station is in London, England, and it just so happens
the sign "Speed ​​Limit 20" which is highlighted in the picture above is very
matches the video below:

The parts above that we highlight are very suitable for the location
that we found on Google Street View, so we
get the conclusion that 100% fits with our theory
created earlier, so we are looking for the name of the street where Westminster is located
The station is and is located on Bridge St, with postal code SW1A 2JR
and is located in the city of London, England. After that we went straight
enter it into the flag with the format
